	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />And David said to him, “Where have you come from?”</para>
	<para style="p">So he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />Then David said to him, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 25:23</char></note>“How did the matter go? Please tell me.”</para>
	<para style="p">And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 4:16; 31:3</char></note>Jonathan his son are dead also.”</para>

	<para style="p">And Joab said, “Let them arise.”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, <char style="it">followers</char> of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. <verse number="16" style="v" />And each one grasped his opponent by the head and <char style="it">thrust</char> his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together.

	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />Now the <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Jer. 41:12</char></note>three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel.

	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />Then Abner looked behind him and said, “<char style="it">Are</char> you Asahel?”</para>
	<para style="p">He answered, “I <char style="it">am.</char>”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <verse number="22" style="v" />So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?” <verse number="23" style="v" />However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Ps. 18:33</char></note>in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot.

Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" />And Joab said, “<char style="it">As</char> God lives, unless <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">2 Sam. 20:12</char></note>you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.” <verse number="28" style="v" />So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore. <verse number="29" style="v" />Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" />So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. <verse number="31" style="v" />But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died. <verse number="32" style="v" />Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which <char style="it">was</char> <char style="it">in</char> <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">2 Sam. 2:14</char></note>Bethlehem.

	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />And David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Now go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.” <verse number="8" style="v" />So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down.
