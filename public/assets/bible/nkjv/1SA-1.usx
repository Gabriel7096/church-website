	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 17:12</char></note>the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Gen. 44:30</char></note>and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. <verse number="2" style="v" />Saul took him that day, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Deut. 13:6; 1 Sam. 20:17; 2 Sam. 1:26</char></note>and would not let him go home to his father’s house anymore. <verse number="3" style="v" />Then Jonathan and David made a <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 17:15</char></note>covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. <verse number="4" style="v" />And Jonathan took off the robe that <char style="it">was</char> on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />So David went out wherever Saul sent him, <char style="it">and</char> behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants. <verse number="6" style="v" />Now it had happened as they were coming <char style="it">home,</char> when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine, that <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 20:8–17</char></note>the women had come out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments. <verse number="7" style="v" />So the women <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Ex. 15:20, 21; Judg. 11:34; Ps. 68:25; 149:3</char></note>sang as they danced, and said:</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />Then Saul was very angry, and the saying <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 21:11; 29:5</char></note>displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed <char style="it">only</char> thousands. Now <char style="it">what</char> more can he have but <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Eccl. 4:4</char></note>the kingdom?” <verse number="9" style="v" />So Saul eyed David from that day forward.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />And it happened on the next day that <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 15:28</char></note>the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 16:14</char></note>and he prophesied inside the house. So David <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 19:24; 1 Kin. 18:29; Acts 16:16</char></note>played <char style="it">music</char> with his hand, as at other times; <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 16:23</char></note>but <char style="it">there</char> <char style="it">was</char> a spear in Saul’s hand. <verse number="11" style="v" />And Saul <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 19:9, 10</char></note>cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />Now Saul was <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 19:10; 20:33</char></note>afraid of David, because <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:15, 29</char></note>the <char style="sc">Lord</char> was with him, but had <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 16:13, 18</char></note>departed from Saul. <verse number="13" style="v" />Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 16:14; 28:15</char></note>he went out and came in before the people. <verse number="14" style="v" />And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Num. 27:17; 1 Sam. 18:16; 29:6; 2 Sam. 5:2</char></note>the <char style="sc">Lord</char> <char style="it">was</char> with him. <verse number="15" style="v" />Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him. <verse number="16" style="v" />But <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Gen. 39:2, 3, 23; Josh. 6:27; 1 Sam. 16:18</char></note>all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Num. 27:16, 17; 1 Sam. 18:5; 2 Sam. 5:2; 1 Kin. 3:7</char></note>I will give her to you as a wife.

	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />So David said to Saul, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:21, 25; 2 Sam. 12:9</char></note>“Who <char style="it">am</char> I, and what <char style="it">is</char> my life <char style="it">or</char> my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?” <verse number="19" style="v" />But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 9:21; 18:23; 2 Sam. 7:18</char></note>Adriel the <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">2 Sam. 21:8</char></note>Meholathite as a wife.</para>

And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. <verse number="21" style="v" />So Saul said, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:28</char></note>the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:17</char></note>“You shall be my son-in-law today.”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />And Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly, and say, ‘Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />So Saul’s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you <char style="it">a</char> light <char style="it">thing</char> to be a king’s son-in-law, seeing I <char style="it">am</char> a poor and lightly esteemed man?” <verse number="24" style="v" />And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “In this manner David spoke.”</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" />Then Saul said, “Thus you shall say to David: ‘The king does not desire any <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:26</char></note>dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">Gen. 34:12; Ex. 22:17</char></note>vengeance on the king’s enemies.’ ” But Saul <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 14:24</char></note>thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. <verse number="26" style="v" />So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king’s son-in-law. Now <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:17</char></note>the days had not expired; <verse number="27" style="v" />therefore David arose and went, he and <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:21</char></note>his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 18:13</char></note>David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" />Thus Saul saw and knew that the <char style="sc">Lord</char> <char style="it">was</char> with David, and <char style="it">that</char> Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him; <verse number="29" style="v" />and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David’s enemy continually. <verse number="30" style="v" />Then the princes of the Philistines <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">2 Sam. 3:14</char></note>went out <char style="it">to</char> <char style="it">war.</char> And so it was, whenever they went out, <char style="it">that</char> David <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">2 Sam. 11:1</char></note>behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “<char style="it">As</char> the <char style="sc">Lord</char> lives, he shall not be killed.” <verse number="7" style="v" />Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">(Deut. 19:10–13)</char></note>as in times past.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, <note style="x" caller="-"><char style="xt" closed="false">1 Sam. 16:21; 18:2, 10, 13</char></note>and struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him.</para>
